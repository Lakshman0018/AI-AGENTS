# AI-AGENTS

üß† Machine Learning Projects Compilation  
---
This repository contains a collection of machine learning and deep learning projects, each focused on solving a distinct real-world problem using structured or unstructured data. The projects include well-documented Jupyter Notebooks with step-by-step implementation.

## üìÇ Projects Included  
---
1. **Health Care Prediction System:**  
A machine learning model designed to predict potential health risks based on patient data. The model uses classification algorithms to detect early signs of diseases and assist in preventative healthcare.

2. **IMDB Sentiment Analysis:**  
A natural language processing (NLP) project that performs sentiment analysis on movie reviews using deep learning techniques such as RNNs and LSTMs.

3. **Cat vs Dog Classifier:**  
A computer vision project that classifies images into cats or dogs using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It includes image preprocessing, augmentation, and training a custom CNN model.

## üöÄ Technologies Used  
---
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas & NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn  
- NLP techniques (for IMDB)  
- CNN (for Cat vs Dog)  
- Data visualization tools  

## üìù Project Structure  
---
Each project notebook contains:

- Dataset loading and exploration  
- Data preprocessing  
- Model building and training  
- Performance evaluation  
- Visualizations and insights  
- Future research directions  

## üìä Outputs  
---
Each model generates metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and visual outputs like:

- Confusion matrices  
- ROC curves  
- Loss vs. accuracy plots  
- Sample predictions  

## üî¨ Future Enhancements  
---
- Hyperparameter tuning  
- Integration with real-time APIs  
- Model deployment using Flask or FastAPI  
- Usage of transfer learning and advanced models  
- Experiment tracking with MLflow
