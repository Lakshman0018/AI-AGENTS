# AI-AGENTS

🧠 Machine Learning Projects Compilation
---
This repository contains a collection of machine learning and deep learning projects, each focused on solving a distinct real-world problem using structured or unstructured data. The projects include well-documented Jupyter Notebooks with step-by-step implementation.

📂 Projects Included
---
1. **Health Care Prediction System**
A machine learning model designed to predict potential health risks based on patient data. The model uses classification algorithms to detect early signs of diseases and assist in preventative healthcare.

3. **IMDB Sentiment Analysis**
A natural language processing (NLP) project that performs sentiment analysis on movie reviews using deep learning techniques such as RNNs and LSTMs.

4. **Cat vs Dog Classifier**
A computer vision project that classifies images into cats or dogs using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It includes image preprocessing, augmentation, and training a custom CNN model.
